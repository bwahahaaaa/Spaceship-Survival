Problem Statement: You are developing a mobile game where players control a spaceship navigating through an asteroid field. The objective is to avoid collisions with the asteroids for as long as possible. The game environment is represented as a 2D grid, where the spaceship can move up, down, left, or right.

Spaceship should pass through the obstacles and try to survive for a maximum time possible. The spaceship can move up(↑), down(↓), right(→), or left(←).

Objective: Design a deep neural network that takes the current state of the game environment (i.e., the positions of the spaceship and asteroids on the grid) as input and outputs the optimal action (i.e., move up, down, left, or right) to maximize the spaceship's survival time.

Additional Information:

The game environment is dynamic, with asteroids moving randomly across the grid. The spaceship's movement speed and agility are constant. The reward system is based on the survival time, with higher rewards for longer survival durations. The neural network should use function approximation to learn the optimal policy for navigating the spaceship through the asteroid field.

Elaborate on, how the described problem could be solved using deep neural network and explain the action plan to create a gaming environment

Environment Setup: Design a 2D grid environment where a spaceship navigates through moving asteroids.

State Representation: Represent the game state with spaceship and asteroid positions.

Action Space: Define discrete actions for the spaceship: up, down, left, and right.

Reward System: Implement a reward function based on survival time without collisions.

Deep Q-Network (DQN):

Neural Network: Create a neural network to map states to actions. Experience Replay: Store experiences to stabilize training. Target Network: Use a separate network for stability. Q-Learning Update: Update Q-values based on observed rewards. Epsilon-Greedy Policy: Balance exploration and exploitation. Training: Interact with the environment, updating the network to maximize rewards.

Testing: Evaluate the trained model to measure performance metrics.

Fine-tuning: Refine the model and environment iteratively for better performance.

Following this plan should lead to an effective spaceship navigation system through the asteroid field.
